# Loops in C++
## Aim
We learn about different loops in C++.
## Theory
1.For Loop
Used when you know how many times you want to repeat a block of code.
`Syntax:`

for (initialization; condition; update){

  code to execute
  
}

2.While Loop
Used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Syntax:

while (condition) {

  code to execute
  
}

3.Do-While Loop
Used when you want to ensure a block of code runs at least once, then repeats as long as a condition is true.

Syntax:

do {
 
  code to execute

}

while (condition);
